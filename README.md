# WeightAgnosticNeuralNetwork
(Python) Simple implementation of Weight Agnostic Neural Network idea on Keras

Not all neural network architectures perform better, and I found the idea of weight agnostic neural network very interesting. In my opinion it combines:
- the idea of genetic algorithm in term of evolution and capcity to learn
- the power of neural networks in term of learning
I implement here the idea presented introduced by Adam Gaier and David Ha, in a more simple version and leveraging Keras.
